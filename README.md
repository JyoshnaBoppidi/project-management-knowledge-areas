## How we work together as a team:

We have planned to use Skype for business or our emails as the primary way of communication. If emergency, we have decided to use the personal mobile numbers as a medium of communication. We decided to meet each other at least thrice a week in library. We think most of the group members are contributing, but if there is someone not participating we will try to know the root cause for that. Together, we will try to resolve any such type of issues and provide motivation to him/her.
